* Universal binaries.
* Finish framework
    - Include translations.
    - Include theme and icon data.
* Write Cocoa application/wrapper for creating stand-alone application
  bundles.
* Build a proper installation package (.pkg) for distribution of the
  SDK.  Since we patched GTK+, do we need to ship with the patches?
* prepare-for-system.sh and convert-to-app-bundle.sh can probably mostly be merged.
* All binaries are non-stripped, need to strip binaries.  As we don't
  ship with the source the debugging info is useless.
