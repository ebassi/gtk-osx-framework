* Universal binaries.
* Finish framework
    - Include translations.
    - Include theme and icon data.
* Write Cocoa application/wrapper for creating stand-alone application
  bundles.
* prepare-for-system.sh and convert-to-app-bundle.sh can probably mostly be merged.
* All binaries are non-stripped, need to strip binaries.  As we don't
  ship with the source the debugging info is useless.


Package TODO:
* Background image in both the installer and DMG.
* Probably put README in RTF so it looks nicer in the installer.
* Try different "To" locations in the installer.
