* Universal binaries.
* Finish framework
    - Include translations.
    - Include theme and icon data.
    - The initializer needs to detect if it's running from /Library/Frameworks or
      from inside an application bundle.  Depending on this it should set the
      environment variables correctly.
* Write Cocoa application/wrapper for creating stand-alone application
  bundles.
* Build a proper installation package (.pkg) for distribution of the
  SDK.
* prepare-for-system.sh and convert-to-app-bundle.sh can probably mostly be merged.
