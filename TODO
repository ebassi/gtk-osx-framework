* Universal binaries.
* Finish framework
    - Include translations.
    - Include theme and icon data.
    - We need to include the dependencies of the GTK+ modules in the framework's
      Libraries/ subdirectory.
    - On Leopard, the environment variables that we set in the framework
      initializer function seem to be gone/cleared once we reach main.
      (This only happens when you run 10.4 binaries on Leopard.  Freshly
       compiled binaries on Leopard do not have this problem).
* Write Cocoa application/wrapper for creating stand-alone application
  bundles.
* Build a proper installation package (.pkg) for distribution of the
  SDK.
* prepare-for-system.sh and convert-to-app-bundle.sh can probably mostly be merged.
