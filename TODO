* Universal binaries.

* Finish framework:
  - Include translations.
  - Fix GTK+ to make the localedir a runtime thing like for Windows.
  - Find out way to work around dyld bug with environment variables.

* Write Cocoa application/wrapper for creating stand-alone application
  bundles.

* prepare-for-system.sh and convert-to-app-bundle.sh can probably mostly be merged.

* All binaries are non-stripped, need to strip binaries. As we don't
  ship with the source the debugging info is useless.


Package TODO:

* Background image in both the installer and DMG.

* Probably put README in RTF so it looks nicer in the installer.

* Try different "To" locations in the installer.
