* Finish framework:

  - Include translations.

  - Fix GTK+ to make the localedir a runtime thing like for Windows.

* Write Cocoa application/wrapper for creating stand-alone application
  bundles.

* prepare-for-system.sh and convert-to-app-bundle.sh can probably
  mostly be merged.

* We need a way to strip the binaries, for distribution. I.e. we keep
  debugging info for the developer package, even without source the
  symbols are useful for development, since you see function names,
  and can check the source.

* Universal binaries? Lots of work.


Package TODO:

* Background image in both the installer and DMG.

* Probably put README in RTF so it looks nicer in the installer.

* Try different "To" locations in the installer.

* Split up glib and autotools setup so that the autotools stuff is
  completely separate, and add more things to it.
